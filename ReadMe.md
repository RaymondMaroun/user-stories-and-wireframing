# User Stories and Wireframing

### Wireframes

_A website wireframe, also known as a **page schematic** or **screen blueprint**, is a visual guide that represents the **skeletal framework** of a **website**._ - Wikipedia

\[...continued...\] **Wireframes** are created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose. The purpose is usually being informed by a business objective and a creative idea. The wireframe depicts the **page layout** or **arrangement** of the website's **content**, including **interface elements** and **navigational systems**, and how they work together. The wireframe usually lacks typographic style, color, or graphics, since the main focus lies in **functionality**, behavior, and priority of content.

The key points to get across when creating a wireframe are:

* Information design
* Navigation design
* Interface design

**An example of a wireframe**

Let's look at the difference between YouTube's page for a particular video and how a wireframe compares:

Wireframes focus on:

* The range of functions available
* The relative priorities of the information and functions
* The rules for displaying certain kinds of information
* The effect of different scenarios on the display

### User Personas

User personas are used in user-centered design and marketing. They can be described as fictional characters created to represent the different user types that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way. Marketers may use personas together with market segmentation, where the qualitative personas are constructed to be representative of specific segments.

### User Stories

Once you have constructed User Personas, to better understand your Users, you must construct User stories to identify each pathway they may want to take through your app or website.

User stories exist in different formats, but this is one that works quite well:

_As a **\[role\]**, I want to **\[goal\]** so I can **\[benefit/purpose\]**_

For example:

* _As a user, I want to read reviews of a selected book to help me decide whether to buy \*\*_
* _As an admin, I want to update the inventory of a selected book so my users know what is available.\*\*_
